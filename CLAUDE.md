# Triplet

Personal single-file trip-planning app (Iceland/Scandinavia, Sept 2026).
Vanilla JS/HTML/CSS in `index.html`, Leaflet + Supabase, deployed via GitHub
Pages on push to `main`. **No build step — this is permanent, not a
temporary simplification.**

## UX principles (learned the hard way — don't repeat these)

- **A list shows everything that matches the active filters, full stop.**
  Never gate list membership on map viewport/zoom/pan. Zoom is a rendering
  concern for the *map layer only* — see `visibleNeighborhoodShapes()`
  (filters only) vs `mapVisibleNeighborhoodShapes()` (adds the zoom gate,
  feeds only `syncNeighborhoodLayers()`). If you add a new listable thing,
  give it the same split.
- **Clicking any list item navigates the map to it** — pan and zoom in
  enough to actually see the thing, regardless of current zoom. Pins do
  this via `focusMap()`/`highlightMarker()`; shapes via `focusShape()`
  (`map.flyToBounds()` on the shape's geometry). A new list item type needs
  the same click-to-navigate behavior, not just a static row.
- Category filter chips (`CATEGORY_COLORS`) are independent of the
  add-form's category dropdown — adding a category to one doesn't require
  touching the other, and the reverse is also true.

## Architecture

- `locations` table: pins (point features) — `city`, `category`, `lat/lng`.
- `neighborhood_shapes` table: districts/streets (area/line features) —
  `city`, `type` (`district`|`street`), `geometry` (array of `[lat,lng]`
  pairs, this app's convention, not GeoJSON). Fetched live from OSM
  (Nominatim polygon / Overpass way) at add time, not hand-authored.
- `cities` table: runtime-extensible city registry, merged into the static
  `CITIES` bootstrap object in `index.html` (never replacing it — that
  object is the offline-safe seed before any fetch resolves).
- The add-location form routes on category alone: `isShapeCategory(category)`
  (true for `district`/`street`) decides both which fields show and which
  table the submit goes to. No separate "this is a shape" toggle.
- RLS pattern, identical across all three tables: public `SELECT`;
  `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` restricted to
  `auth.jwt() ->> 'email' IN ('adamtrabold@gmail.com', 'ericatrabold@gmail.com')`.

## Environment constraints

- An agent's sandbox typically **cannot reach Supabase, Nominatim, or
  Overpass directly** (network egress blocked). DB migrations must be
  handed to the user to run manually in the Supabase SQL editor; anything
  depending on live Nominatim/Overpass calls (e.g. `tools/*.html`) must run
  in the user's own browser, not be fetched by the agent.
- The user often works from a phone — don't hand them a file they can't
  open. Prefer pasting copy-pasteable text directly in chat, or an Artifact
  with a copy button, over `SendUserFile` for anything they need to paste
  elsewhere (like SQL for the Supabase editor).
